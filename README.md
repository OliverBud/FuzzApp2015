Hello! Thanks for looking at this app.

Some cool things about it: I used lazy loading to get content on the screen quickly and load images into this lists inthe background.
I used this blog to help me out with that: http://codehenge.net/blog/2011/06/android-development-tutorial-asynchronous-lazy-loading-and-caching-of-listview-images/

Handles bad network connection, lets you retry untill there is internet access

Used some cool activity image transitions

Some things that are not so cool: I didnt really spend any time styling the app so it looks a little messy. That can be a rabbit hole that I did not want to go down, but obviously with more time I would make it look nicer

Image loading/sizing/scaling was problematic. I did the best I could to display images large but still clear. was made harder by Memory Exceptions


THanks again for checking it out!
